  <p><i>Satisfied with my excursion, I checked on the ferries. Schedules were
red, ticket sales were axed, leaving me stranded on the island. The sky gloomed
into a stormy surprise. I returned downtown to figure things out. Strong winds
forced me out of an overnight wait. Inns were available from USD 60 ($82.8), but
I wasn't willing to pay much for my mistake. After some scrambling, I booked a
bunk bed listed for USD 30. I signed over house rules shared among strangers. At
dark, I pressed the buzzer to be let in. The receptionist got my name and a $100
deposit. I got two keys and a <q>DORM BED CARD</q> which resembles a receipt.</i

  <p><i>The second floor started with a gate I used one key on. The other
unlocked the room door which had its knobs backwards. Rooms were grouped each
with a bathroom. Inside the room were three stacks of two beds of which mine was
vacant, two cabinets of three lockers, a fridge among minor details, cramped in
a three-by-four. On my bed were a pillow, linen, and blanket, all neatly set.
Lights were off but someone's warm halogen provided ample visibility. A window
was open enough for ventilation and sanity. Indoor ambient noise consisted of
doors, footsteps, and music. The bathroom was equipped with flush toilet, sink,
top shelf with mug, and shower which had a L'Oréal® Total Clean® 3-in-1 I fondly
remembered using.</i></p>
  <p><i>I lied down for a bit to determine my overnight position. The pillow was
thin, and the sheets were rough. I went down to borrow a charger from the front
desk in exchange for a piece of ID. It was a fast charger. Excited and curious,
I returned to try it out. Outlets were within an arm's length so I could remain
on bed. It worked like magic. Twelve hours passed since I left home. With me
were my keys, phone, wallet, lip balm, transit pass, chips, hunger, and anxiety.
<q>Will I make it? Will I really do it? What'll happen to me?</q> I decided to
at least have some dinner. I went down again to borrow a lock pad--and its keys
of course--in exchange for $10. I surveyed the adjacent bar, then back. I used
the locker to store non-sensitives, while my wallet remained secure in my
jacket's zip pocket.</i></p>
  <p><i>I went outside. Many were closed, but I managed to provision a pack of
facial tissue and a bottle of water. As I exited the dollar store, some trash
almost ran over me chasing their <q>fucking bike.</q> The alleged theft fell as
they paddled away, and the whole thing turned out to be a false positive. I went
to the Japanese restaurant closeby. Inside was crowded and noisy, but I got my
table right away. Their online menu was uneasy to maneuver around. I ordered my
dish and waited. Dining in such an establishment alone was uncomfortable.
Everyone was socializing while I remained still and quiet. As some escape, I
pulled out my phone to read the news.</i></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><i>My dish came.</i></p>

  <p><i>It was served on a hot sizzling bowl. I finished the article before my
first bite. They put too much teriyaki sauce, and forgot my courtesy water which
I later asked for. Otherwise, everything was well: +18%. I left the
establishment and walked back to the hostel. Smokers were hanging around the
front door. I readied my keys. Someone was going in and held the door for me. I
raised my keys and thanks. I stowed my bottle into the locker; took off my
footwear, then my jacket to use it as pillow support; set my phone to Do Not
Disturb, Vibrate, 0% brightness, and 0% volume; and finally lied down.</i></p>

  <p><i>I tuned into traffic radio on the Internet and set my phone close to my
left ear. It seemed that mainlanders were hit hard by the storm. Onto news
radio. Nothing much new. Just a remediation of the news I've read. For the
remainder, I left my phone on public radio close to my right ear. Meanwhile,
occupants went in and out. One of them hi-ed me to which I hey-ed. After
switching between ears and sleeping positions, I finally fell asleep albeit
uncomfortably and inconsistently with phone activities between. Complicating the
situation were my high anxiety levels and loud snores. Earplugs were available,
but I unthoughtfully refused. I woke up just before midnight, then 01, 03, and
06.</i></p>
  <p><i>I got up at 07, wore my jacket, went to the bathroom to brush up, then
downstairs for breakfast. I surveyed the buffet beside the front desk and was
impressed. I decided to dig in. With the proper apparatus from the communal
kitchen, I got a waffle, toasted and topped with <q>Syrup</q>; a hard-boiled egg
which was strangely cold to the touch; and a glass of apple juice. Excited, I
sat down on a big table in the bar. Having ensured that I wasn't being watched,
I grabbed the waffle with both hands and yummy--it was indeed maple syrup. On
the walls, there were two Roku TVs logged into multiple accounts, none of which
were on the morning newscasts. Ignoring the tellies, I moved on to the eggs. It
was over done, and of course they didn't have the sweet soy sauce to soften the
blow. Satiated, I took my dirty dishes back to the kitchen, dumped the egg shell
into the compost bin, and washed them my way. Meanwhile, someone was cooking a
panful of spaghetti that looked good. I went back up to ready my phone.</i></p>
