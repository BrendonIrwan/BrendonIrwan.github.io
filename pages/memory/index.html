  <p><i>From September 14th, 2013 until 03 17 today, my digital life was
constrained to four gigabytes (4 GB) of single-channel memory. My 2021 <em
>budget</em> smartphone has a similar configuration, putting my 2017 <em
>business-class</em> laptop out of whack for a couple of years. It is still
usable today, but becoming less viable following continuous evolutions to my
computer activities.</i></p>
  <p><i>Video authoring brought the most frustrations. In most projects, I had
to save my work and reload Shotcut regularly to alleviate on memory before it
leaks into swap space, if not constantly nagging about being low on memory, for
which there was nothing else I could do other than to needlessly telling it to
shut up.</i></p>
  <p><i>Web development involves one or two browsers with development tools, and
a source code editor. In addition, one browser may have extra tabs for looking
up technical references on the Internet. VSCodium may be in place of my usual
source code editors. From here, I could afford running a third test browser
before leaking into swap space. Meanwhile, there are times when I would manually
run a garbage collection to free up memory.</i></p>
  <p><i>My digital life is archived with LZMA2 on 7-Zipâ€™s Ultra preset. This
consumes much of 4 GB, so nothing else was open to avoid leaking into swap
space. Therefore, during archive operations, I would leave the computer and go
do something else.</i></p>
  <p><i>Several scholar instructions required me to use some application, often
big. Miro is the worst offender: <q>the online collaborative whiteboard
platform</q> with titanic canvases spreading over one gigabyte of memory. During
group meetings, I had to close it before using Google Workspace. In fact,
running two productivity web applications side-by-side without leaking into swap
space is often impossible.</i></p>
  <p><i>First, 4 GB can hold at most one big activity. Switching activities
often required packing away stuffs relevant to the old to make way for the new.
Second, I set up swap space to cushion malign behaviors such as memory leaks,
and enable suspend to disk features. Relying on it for everyday activities is
unhealthy; it wears on my disk for severe performance hits.</i></p>
  <p><i>A memory upgrade is inexpensive, readily available, and future proof.
The resulting dual-channel configuration should boost memory-intensive processes
especially real-time graphics. But the main attraction is being able to enjoy
the computational capacities others have lived with for so many years. While a
memory upgrade enables me to leave all ongoing work open to write this post, I
rather not develop (anymore) bad digital habits.</i></p>
  <p><i>Still, I am perplexed on how people can have over eleven browser tabs
open and live a normal life at the same time. Maybe it was memory after all.</i
